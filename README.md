# TheFamily - UI tabs to cleanup screen space
Sometimes, mods love add own UI on a screen. But what if there's so much mods so there's no space at all or, even worse, elements stacks on each other?
That's exactly what this mod trying to solve!

TheFamily - a lovely mod which designed to provide API for making tabs and easier management of UI in Balatro's game screen.

## How it works
Other mods can interact with API mod provides to make own tabs which player can use as it will to display/hide certain UIs like counters, menus, buttons, card areas etc.
All of them placed in one place and easy accessible in any time.

## WIP
Mod still in early development. Performance issues and bugs can be present. API will be updated/expanded. Mod config will be added too.
